<p>Dear Peter</p>
<p>Re: Sales Assistant Vacancy (vacancy number 40568)</p>
<p>I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on<br>
Trade Me on 14 February 2013.</p>
<p>I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the<br>
position, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>time management and strong organisational skills</li>
<li>high-level customer service and friendly relationship management</li>
<li>cash handing and sales ability</li>
<li>motivation and dedication</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Sales Assistant at a shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer<br>
service skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career. The<br>
Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail<br>
career.</p>
<p>I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use<br>
my skills to benefit your organisation at an interview.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
